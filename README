 
******  QUICK GUIDE FOR GETTING STARTED  ******

Before you build the code, you must configure it to the
situation where it should be used

1) Select overall configuration of code by copying  the 
   file config.mk into the base directory (where this file is)
   The file config.mk tells which modules should be used for
   PHYSICAL_FIELDS, PARTICLE_STATE and TASK
   There are a set of examples in directory setups/configurations

2) Select a compiler by copying a file compiler_defaults.mk  into the 
   base directory (where this file is). compiler_defaults.mk
   contains defaults compiler/link flags
   There are a set of examples in the directory setups/compilers
   

3) Build the selected configuration by typing 
     make 
   at the command line 
   

If a standard setup is applied steps 1-2 above can be accelerated
by running a standard script doing steps 1-2. 
There are some examples in setups/combo_scripts.
Run these in the base directory (where this file is) e.g. type:
   setups/combo_scripts/quick_ifort_minimal
at the command line


Testing IBMlib: IBMlib comes with a self test suite. If testing 
is the first thing you do, you can just put an empty file for config.mk
by typing "touch config.mk" instead of step 1 above (but any file will work).
Then select a compiler (step 2 above) and finally type:
   make test
at the command line. A summary of the self test will be printed at the screen
at the end of (a successful) self test.
