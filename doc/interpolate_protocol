Should we do

 1) interpolate_X(buffer,status)

or 

 2) interpolate("X",buffer,status)
 
====================================================
advantages of 1 over 2:
  
 speed: redelegation to internal interpolate_X
        is done at compile time. Option 2) needs to do a string comparison
        with a property lookup table for each call 
        (i.e. for each particle each time step)
        Alternatively, interpolate(ix,buffer,status)
        where ix is a named integer constant defined in a 
        symbol module (less elegant)
 
features: if interpolation of X is requested without
          a matching provider, in case of 1) it is a 
          compile time error and in case of 2) it is a 
	  run time error.
