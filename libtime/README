  libtime (C) by Thomas Forbriger (IfG Stuttgart) 1997

  A FORTRAN library to manipulate absolute and relative data times
  with a large dynamic range.
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------

time format declaration
 
  the absolute time value is stored in an integer array:
 
  integer date(7)
  date(1)=year
  date(2)=day of year
  date(3)=hour
  date(4)=minute
  date(5)=second
  date(6)=millisecond
  date(7)=microsecond

A year of value 0 will indicate that this is a relative time. This
affects the routines time_norm and time_getdate and time_sprint.
Notice that the routine time_fullyear will NOT be affected by this
declaration and will set a year of value 0 to 2000.
 
The best way to be aware of absolute/relative time confusion is
to finish every manual setting of absolute times by a call to
time_finish and to keep the year value fo relative times zero 
in any case.
 
Absolute times are only accepted from year 100 on. Users must expect
some routines to set year values below 100 to the range of 1970 to 2069.

Only positive time values will be accepted. Therefore routines like
time_sub will return only the absolute value of the difference.
