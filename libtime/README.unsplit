This is the introductory part to the solid block libtime.f from which the
new kernel was derived. It is conserved here to document chnages applied in
the past an the library shape that might be expected by older programs.

REVISIONS and CHANGES
  27/05/97   V1.0   first version
  25/06/97   V1.01  changed write(1, *) error messages to print *,
                    changed time_compare looking for date(1) instead
                    of date(0)
  13/08/97   V1.02  time_clear still did clear up to element 8
  02/02/99   V1.03  added time_read
  01/08/00   V1.04  in time_read: if month value OR year value is greater
                    than zero expect absolute time
  05/08/00          I'm about to split the whole thing into pieces
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------

time format declaration
 
  the absolute time value is stored in an integer array:
 
  integer date(7)
  date(1)=year
  date(2)=day of year
  date(3)=hour
  date(4)=minute
  date(5)=second
  date(6)=millisecond
  date(7)=microsecond

A year of value 0 will indicate that this is a relative time. This
affects the routines time_norm and time_getdate and time_sprint.
Notice that the routine time_fullyear will NOT be affected by this
declaration and will set a year of value 0 to 2000.
 
The best way to be aware of absolute/relative time confusion is
to finish every manual setting of absolute times by a call to
time_finish and to keep the year value fo relative times zero 
in any case.
 
Absolute times are only accepted from year 100 on. Users must expect
some routines to set year values below 100 to the range of 1970 to 2069.

Only positive time values will be accepted. Therefore routines like
time_sub will return only the absolute value of the difference.

time_getdate           get date from doy                      V1.0
time_sprint            print time to character array          V1.0
time_clear             clears a time record to zero           V1.0
time_norm              set all field to correct value range   V1.0
time_add               add two time records                   V1.0
time_sub               calculate difference                   V1.0
time_copy              copy a time record                     V1.0
time_finish            finish setting of absolute time value  V1.0
time_compare           compare two time values                V1.0
time_mul               multiply relative time by integer n    V1.0
time_div               divide relative time by integer n      V1.0
time_nfit              find number of samples fiitng in time  V1.0
time_read              extra time from a timestring           V1.03
