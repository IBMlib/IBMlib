  Invoking test sets:

    1) It is recommended to apply setups/compilers/FC/compiler_defaults_safe.mk
       as $(IBMLIB_DIR)/compiler_defaults.mk
    2) In $(IBMLIB_DIR) invoke: make fulltest  ... or 
    3) In this directory invoke: 
              make fulltest     ... or 
              make TESTNAME     
       where TESTNAME corresponds to a sub directory containing a test in this directory

  Prerequisites:
    It is assumed the standard Linux scripting languages are available wtihin 
    the binary search path as well, in addition to prerequisites to IBMlib


  Protocol for new tests:

    1) A test is associated with a directory TESTNAME having the name of the test

    2) The test must be executed by an (executable) script TESTNAME/runtest.
       The script must be any standard Linux scripting language (*sh,python,perl)
       The test invoked by TESTNAME/runtest must be self contained and able to
       be invoked independtly. All data and sources must be available in TESTNAME 
       or part of the resident IBMlib distribution. 

    3) The test script must summarize the reults of the test in TESTNAME/test_summary
       The test_summary should be short and conclusive and end with either line

       "result TESTNAME: test OK"      or 
       "result TESTNAME: test FAILED" (... or just crash)

       In other words TESTNAME/runtest TESTNAME/test_summary are mandatory and reserved
  
    4) The code should preferably build into the executable ibmrun_test
       to avoid accidental confusion with the normal name ibmrun for the
       executable object

  Other parts of test_suite:
    * test_pbi is a stand alone test usefull for testing a new PBI
