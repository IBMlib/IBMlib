Provides a brute-force test of the coastline intersection routine contained
in a full working PBI. The test is predicated on a particle walking randomly
around the wet domain space and interacting with the coastline. Options are 
configured by the external controlfile. The test is most effective if the
user can maximise the number of coastline interactions, either by having a
long step size, or starting the bee particle in an area that is naturally 
(or artificially, for the sake of the test) closed.
   
Control file options
--------------------
* advec_intg_method  [string: euler/rk2/rk4] - not used by the bee_test 
  directly, but is required for consistency with the particle advection 
  schemes etc. 
* start_geo [real(3): lon, lat, depth] - specifies the longitude, latitude 
  and depth at which the bee particle will start
* stability [real] - used to specify the number of steps for which the
  test should be run. Expressed as log10 of the number of steps ie Number 
  of steps = 10^stability
* write_traj [integer] - Flag to indicate whether to write an output trajector
  or not. 0 is silent, all other values write trajectory. Care should be taken 
  for stabilities above 6, as this corresponds to around 30MB of disk space. 
  Higher stabilities can easily fill your hard disk
* step_size [real] - length of the step size, in metres, for the bee to take

Helper functions
--------------------
* Plot_bee.r - R script to read a trajectory produced by the bee_test and write
  a pdf. Can easily produce unmanageably large pdfs if stability is too high eg
  stability = 6 gives a 16MB pdf that takes a long time to render
