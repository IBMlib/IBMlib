 
******  QUICK GUIDE FOR GETTING STARTED  ******

Before you build the code, you must configure it to the
situation where it should be used

1) Select overall configuration of code by copying  the 
   file config.mk into the base directory (where this file is)
   The file config.mk tells which modules should be used for
   PHYSICAL_FIELDS, PARTICLE_STATE and TASK

   There are a set of examples in directory Setups/Configurations

2) Select a compiler by copying a file compiler_defaults.mk  into the 
   base directory (where this file is). compiler_defaults.mk
   contains defaults compiler/link flags
   
   There are a set of examples in the directory /Setups/Compilers

3) Build the code by typing 
     make 
   at the command line
  

If a standard setup is applied steps 1-2 above can be accelerated
by running a standard script doing steps 1-2. 
There are some examples in Setups/ComboScripts.
Run these in the base directory (where this file is) e.g. type:
   Setups/ComboScripts/quick_ifort_minimal
at the command line
